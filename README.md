# BlackBerry Manager
BlackBerry Manager provides an easy way to download, install and update ad-free BlackBerry apps on your Android device. Discover BlackBerry's Message Hub and experience other apps made by BlackBerry such as Calendar, Contacts, Keyboard, Launcher and more.

<b>Features of Blackberry Manager</b>
* Download ad-free BlackBerry apps from Play Store, including the BlackBerry exclusive Keyboard app
* Automatic notifications when updates are available
* Easy to use permissions configuration dialog (tap app icon after installing an app)
 
<b>System Requirements to run BlackBerry apps</b>
* Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or better
* 2 GB or more of RAM and a screen density between 420 and 640 dpi
* Tablets are partially supported

<b>Permission Requirements</b>
* GET_ACCOUNTS to read the Google account authentication token and to login to Google Play
* READ_PHONE_STATE to read your device specs, needed to checkin with Google Play
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to save and modify the downloaded apps

<b>Installation</b><br>
Either install all apps from BlackBerry Manager (full functionality, no ads) or install all apps from Play Store (subscription required after 30 days). The Keyboard can be used in both scenarios. BlackBerry Manager automatically hides apps that have been installed directly from Play Store, because they are not signature compatible. To use all apps from BlackBerry Manager, you first have to uninstall the versions that you downloaded directly from Play Store.

<b>Security</b><br>
This app contains no malware and does not inject malware into the downloaded apps. The default Android developer signature is used to sign the downloaded and patched apps. That signature may cause a false malware alert in some Antivirus solutions. You can safely ingnore those warnings.
